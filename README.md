# Regression EC with Simulated Datasets

Used six different distributed datasets to analyze the correlation of the well-known GoF with newly proposed regression error consistency (EC) metrics. Here, we used 5-fold external holdout cross-validation and we repeated the process for 50 times.


Use `python3 -m src.regression_EC` to execute the main function!
